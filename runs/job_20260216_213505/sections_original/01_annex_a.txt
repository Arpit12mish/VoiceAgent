Example of respirometric system based on CO2 measurement

The measurement of the evolved CO2 can be obtained by trapping the evolved CO2 in a closed system and then by quantifying it by suitable titration systems. Microorganisms in the vessel consume the
oxygen and form CO2. This is absorbed by a CO2 absorber (generally NaOH) that can then be titrated to determine the amount of the absorbed CO2.

In a typical case, a 250 ml vessel is used. The sediment occupies about 20 ml, the seawater 70 ml and the headspace 160 ml. The O2 present in air at 1 atm and 28 °C and a relative humidity of 100 % is about
0,261 mg/ml. This means that the O2 available at the beginning is 0,261 mg/ml × 160 ml = 41,76 mg (1,305 mmol). The amount dissolved in the seawater can be neglected. This amount of O2 is sufficient
to oxidize to CO2 and H2O an amount of biodegradable organic carbon equal to 15,66 mg and producing 1,305 × 44 = 57,42 mg of CO2.

The system is opened in order to refresh the headspace when the O2 concentration reaches 25 % of the original oxygen concentration.
