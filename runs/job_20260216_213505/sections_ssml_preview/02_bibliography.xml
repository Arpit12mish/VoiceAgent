Review of Indian Standards<break time="350ms"/>
Amendments are issued to standards as the need arises on the basis of comments. Standards are also reviewed periodically; a standard along with amendments is reaffirmed when such review indicates that no changes are needed; if the review indicates that changes are needed, it is taken up for revision. Users of Indian Standards should ascertain that they are in possession of the latest amendments or edition by referring to the website- www.bis.gov.in or www.standardsbis.in.<break time="350ms"/>
This Indian Standard has been developed from Doc No.: PCD 27 (18151).<break time="350ms"/>
