Annex A (informative)

Overview of the syntax service code list directory

FOR BIS USE ONLY

A.1 General

In order to illustrate the usage of the coded data elements shown in the service simple data elements directory, this annex specifies the syntax service code list directory with a link to the external code list.

The syntax service code list directory is maintained by ISO/TC 154/JWG1, Joint syntax working group (with UN/ECE).

The complete ISO 9735 syntax service code list directory is published on the JWG1 website https://​ www​ .gefeg​ .com/​ jswg/​ v4x/​ data/​ v4x​ .html.

NOTE

Each code list below is showing only one code entry as an example.

A.2 Code lists

Change indicators (in comparison with previous release of the syntax service code list):

a plus sign (+)

for an addition

an asterisk (*)

for an addition/subtraction/change to an entry for a particular data element

a hash sign (#)

for changes to names

a vertical bar (|)

for changes to text for descriptions, notes and functions

an X sign (X)

for marked for deletion

Details of the data elements are specified in Table A.1 to Table A.52.
