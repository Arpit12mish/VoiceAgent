Example of respirometric system based on CO2 measurement<break time="350ms"/>
The measurement of the evolved CO2 can be obtained by trapping the evolved CO2 in a closed system and then by quantifying it by suitable titration systems. Microorganisms in the vessel consume the oxygen and form CO2. This is absorbed by a CO2 absorber (generally NaOH) that can then be titrated to determine the amount of the absorbed CO2.<break time="350ms"/>
In a typical case, a 250 millilitres vessel is used. The sediment occupies about 20 millilitres, the seawater 70 millilitres and the headspace 160 millilitres. The O2 present in air at 1 atm and 28 degree celsius and a relative humidity of 100 % is about 0.261 milligrams/ml. This means that the O2 available at the beginning is 0.261 milligrams/ml × 160 millilitres = 41.76 milligrams (1.305 mmol). The amount dissolved in the seawater can be neglected. This amount of O2 is sufficient to oxidize to CO2 and H2O an amount of biodegradable organic carbon equal to 15.66 milligrams and producing 1.305 × 44 = 57.42 milligrams of CO2.<break time="350ms"/>
The system is opened in order to refresh the headspace when the O2 concentration reaches 25 % of the original oxygen concentration.<break time="350ms"/>
