This Indian Standard which is identical to IEC 60867 : 2022 ‘Insulating liquids — Specifications for
unused liquids based on synthetic aromatic hydrocarbons’ issued by the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on the recommendation of the Fluids
for Electrotechnical Applications Sectional Committee and approval of the Electrotechnical Division
Council.
This Indian Standard covers specifications and test methods for unused synthetic aromatic
hydrocarbons intended for use as insulating liquid in cables and capacitors.
The text of IEC standard has been approved as suitable for publication as an Indian Standard without
deviations. Certain terminologies and conventions are, however, not identical to those used in Indian
Standards. Attention is particularly drawn to the following:
Wherever the words ‘International Standard’ appear referring to this standard, they should
a)
be read as ‘Indian Standard’; and
Comma (,) has been used as a decimal marker, while in Indian Standards the current
b)
practice is to use a point (.) as the decimal marker.
In this standard, reference appears to International Standards for which Indian Standards also exists.
The corresponding Indian Standards, which are to be substituted, are listed below along with their
degree of equivalence for the editions indicated:

Only the English language text has been retained while adopting it in this Indian Standard, and as such,
the page numbers given here are not the same as in the IEC Publication.
For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with the final
value, observed or calculated expressing the result of a test or analysis shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2 : 2022 ‘Rules for rounding of numerical values (second revision)’. The number of significant
places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.
