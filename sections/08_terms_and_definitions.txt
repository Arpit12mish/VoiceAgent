Identification and general delivery requirements
Identification and general delivery requirements are as follows:
a) The synthetic aromatic hydrocarbons type of liquid is normally delivered in bulk, rail-tank
cars, tank containers or packed in drums or intermediate bulk containers (IBC). These shall
be clean and suitable for this purpose to avoid any contamination. The supplier shall take
all the precautions to ensure the delivery product will be in accordance with the requirements
of this document.
b) Drums and sample containers shall carry at least the following markings:
–
supplier's designation;
–
labelling in accordance with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and
Labelling of Chemicals (GHS);
–
liquid quantity.
c)
As agreed between the supplier and purchaser each liquid delivery shall be accompanied
by a document specifying the supplier’s designation, labelling and compliance certificate. A
delivery shall be traceable to a manufactured batch.
d) The supplier shall declare the generic type of all additives, and the concentrations in the
case of antioxidants and passivators.
5
Sampling
Sampling shall be carried out in accordance with the procedure described in IEC 60475.
6
Test methods
6.1
Appearance
Appearance shall be evaluated by examining, in transmitted light, a representative sample of
the liquid having a thickness of approximately 10 cm, at ambient temperature.
6.2
Density
Density shall be measured in accordance with ISO 12185 (reference method). ISO 3675 and
ASTM D7042 are acceptable.
6.3
Kinematic viscosity
Kinematic viscosity shall be measured according to ISO 3104 (reference method) or ASTM
D7042.
6.4
Flash point
Flash point shall be determined according to ISO 2592.
6.5
Pour point
Pour point shall be determined according to ISO 3016.
6.6
Acidity
Acidity shall be measured according to the IEC 62021 series. Any part of the IEC 62021 series
(IEC 62021-1 or IEC 62021-2 or IEC 62021-3) can be used.
3
IS/IEC 60867 : 2022
6.7
Chlorine content
Chlorine content shall be determined using a test method according to ISO 9562 for the
determination of adsorbable organically bound halogens (AOX) or ASTM D4929 for the
determination of organic chloride content in crude oil or ASTM D7536 for the determination of
chlorine in aromatics by monochromatic wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence
spectrometry. The method described in Annex A can also be used.
6.8
Water content
Water content shall be determined according to IEC 60814.
6.9
Corrosive and potentially corrosive sulphur
Corrosive and potentially corrosive sulphur shall be determined according to DIN 51353 and
ASTM D1275 and IEC 62535.
6.10 Additives
The chemical family of all additives shall be declared in product data sheets and certificates of
compliance. For antioxidant additives and passivators (IEC 60666), their concentrations shall
also be stated.
6.11 Breakdown voltage
Breakdown voltage shall be determined according to IEC 60156.
6.12 Dielectric dissipation factor and volume resistivity
The properties shall be determined according to IEC 60247 (reference method) or IEC 61620.
6.13 Gassing tendency
The gassing shall be determined by Method A of IEC 60628.
NOTE Synthetic aromatic hydrocarbon compositions have been used as additive to improve the gassing tendency
of insulating liquids.
6.14 Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) content
Synthetic aromatic hydrocarbons shall be free from PCBs. The reference test method is
IEC 61619.
NOTE Acceptable limits of total or individual PCBs are specified in national and local regulations. Further European
specifications are described in Directive 96/59/EC and UN Guidelines for the identification of PCBs and materials
containing PCBs.
