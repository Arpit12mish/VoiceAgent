IR spectra of typical synthetic aromatic hydrocarbons
NOTE All IR spectra conditions are: KBr cells between wavelength 400 cm−1 to 4 000 cm−1.
B.1
IR spectra typical of the family of alkylbenzenes
See Figure B.1 and Figure B.2.

Figure B.2 – IR spectra of linear alkylbenzenes
NOTE The two types of alkylbenzene shown in Figure B.1 and Figure B.2 can be distinguished by infrared
spectrophotometric analysis. The straight-chain type shows a single absorption peak in the region 1 360 cm−1 to
1 380 cm−1 and the branched-chain type shows a double peak in that region.
B.2
Alkyldiphenylethanes
See Figure B.3.
Figure B.3 – IR spectrum of phenylxylylethane (PXE)
NOTE Phenylxylylethane (PXE) is characterized by infrared absorption bands at 3 070 cm−1, 1 606 cm−1 and
705 cm−1.

Methylpolyarylmethanes
See Figure B.5 and Figure B.6.
Figure B.5 – IR spectrum of monobenzyltoluene (MBT)
NOTE Methylpolyarylmethanes are characterized by infrared absorption bands at 3 025 cm−1, 1 606 cm−1 and
705 cm−1.
