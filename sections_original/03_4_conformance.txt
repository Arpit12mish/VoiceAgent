4 Conformance

Whereas this document shall use a version number of “4” in the mandatory data element 0002 (Syntax version number), and shall use a release number of “02” in the conditional data element 0076 (Syntax release number), each of which appears in the segment UNB (Interchange header), interchanges continuing to use the syntax defined in the earlier published versions shall use the following Syntax version numbers, in order to differentiate them from each other and from this document:

— ISO 9735:1988: Syntax version number: 1

— ISO 9735:1988 (amended and reprinted in 1990): Syntax version number: 2

— ISO 9735:1988 and ISO 9735:1988/Amd 1:1992: Syntax version number: 3

— ISO 9735:1998 (all parts): Syntax version number: 4
