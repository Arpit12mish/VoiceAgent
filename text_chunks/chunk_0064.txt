Overview of the syntax service code list directory



A.1 General

In order to illustrate the usage of the coded data elements shown in the service simple data elements directory, this annex specifies the syntax service code list directory with a link to the external code list.

The syntax service code list directory is maintained by ISO/TC 154/JWG1, Joint syntax working group (with UN/ECE).

The complete ISO 9735 syntax service code list directory is published on the JWG1 website https://​ www​.gefeg​.com/​jswg/​v4x/​data/​v4x​.html.

NOTE

Each code list below is showing only one code entry as an example.
